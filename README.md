# 🧩 JavaScript Array Interview Problems

Welcome to **js-array-interview-problems**, a collection of carefully designed JavaScript problems focused on mastering **arrays** — from foundational manipulation to real-world transformations using `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, and more.

This repository is a continuation of the [js-string-interview-problems](https://github.com/navneeth-sortur/js-strings-interview-problems) series, aiming to provide **hands-on practice with clean code, test-driven solutions, and time-space complexity insights.**
